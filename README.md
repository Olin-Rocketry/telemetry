# Telemetry

Repository for all Olin Rocketry hardware and software pertaining to testing and telemetry.

The purpose of the telemetry system is to provide a combined hardware/software solution that will
- increase safety and efficiency (i.e. data-logging) of static engine test fires
- receive real-time data from the flight computer for launches and prior testing
